# Research Motivation
In evaluating audience reception of films, factors such as actor performance, genre, and budget have been extensively studied as significant predictors of individual ratings (Wallace et al., 1993). Runtime, frequently included as a control variable in prior research, also carries meaningful implications for audience perception (Ashari et al., 2022). A longer duration of the movie often reflects higher production value and suggests a narrative depth that justifies viewers’ time investment. However, excessive runtime may adversely affect enjoyment due to decreased audience attention and potential fatigue. 

Empirical evidence on the relationship between movie duration and audience ratings remains inconclusive. Some studies identify a positive association, whereas others report a non-linear or genre specific effect. To address this gap, the current study investigates the influence of movie duration on audience ratings. 

Given that rating behaviour and audience preferences evolve over time (Amendola et al., 2015), we incorporate release year as a control variable to enhance the internal validity of our analysis and account for temporal dynamics in consumer behaviour.

# Research Question
To what extent does movie duration influence audience ratings, controlling for release year?
