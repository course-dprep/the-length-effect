# The influence of movie duration on audience raitings, controling for release year
*Describe the purpose of this project* 

## Motivation

In evaluating audience reception of films, factors such as actor performance, genre, and budget have been extensively studied as significant predictors of individual ratings (Wallace et al., 1993).

*Academic relevance*

This research addresses an underexplored dimension of firm evaluation. While previous research has mainly focused on factors such as actor performance (Liu et al., 2013), genre (Gupta et al., 2025), film directors (Antipov & Pokryshevskaya, 2016), and firm revenue (Zhang, 2025) as the main predictors of audience engagement, movie duration impact has often been relegated to the role of a control variable. Existing findings on the effect of movie duration remain unclear some studies report a positive association between longer runtimes and audience ratings (Choudhary et al., 2024), others highlight that the effect varies across genres (Kaimann & Pannicke, 2015), and very few have explicitly examined potential non-linear relationships such as optimal length or diminishing returns. By using the movie duration as a central variable in our analysis this study will bridge the gap between audience reception and film economics, clarifying how structural characteristics of movies influence evaluation across different temporal contexts. Furthermore, by introducing the release year as a controlling variable it will help academics understand what is the impact over time. In doing so, the study adds to theoretical discussions in media consumption, film economics, and the attention economy by examining whether longer content is consistently perceived as more valuable or whether it risks undermining audience satisfaction.

**To what extent does movie duration influence audience ratings, controlling for release year?**

## Data
In this study, we use publicly available IMDb datasets: title.basics, containing metadata about movie titles (including release year and duration), and title.ratings, containing aggregate user ratings. The datasets are retrieved in TSV format from the IMDb website and merged using tconst. From the original set of variables, we focus on three that are relevant to our research question: movie duration (runtime_minutes), IMDb user rating (average_rating), and release year (start_year).
After merging, cleaning, and aggregating, the datasets consists of 301,411 observations. This reduction in the number of observations is due to the process of merging and cleaning the data. In particular, missing values were removed, films with unrealistic durations (0 minutes or longer than 300 minutes) were excluded, and films listed as released in 2026 (which probably do not yet have complete ratings) were omitted.
